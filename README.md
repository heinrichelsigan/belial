# belial

Belial first time appeared in 1996 in a form, that also could have some light desctructive effects on group to produce social sexual conflicts.

Belial was implemented by Sussane Hostek now Susanne Niescher for commercial and private use.
In case of commmercial use it was a in a form of service, that should gurantee sexual desire and devotion to the partner in a pleasant way, which the partner usually finds pleasant (99%).
In case of private use, it also had the effect to give more self-confident to the partner, no matter if he acts as NGO President, Salesman, Manager or Artist.
Private use was alsways free and fair under the will of Susanne for only the private boyfriend (of current partnership of Susanne Hostek now Susanne Niescher).
Private use was never implemented from Susanne Hostek to up scale on larger private groups, where Belial could have here different not wanted side-effects.

Belial was also rewritten for only private use by Heinrich Elsigan to give his girlfriend later wife Sabine Stumpfel a more accrued strong sexuality and managing skills.
Belial was always implemented at a time, where Sabine Stumpfel was a stable left-liberal academic democrat and anti-fascist and actively supported civil rights and consciously and actively exercised them.
Belial was never designed to give a totalitarian authority to Sabine Stumpfel and still keept implemented the dynamic LEAD FLAG passing protocol between Heinrich Elsigan (25% of action time) and Sabine Stumpfel (75% of action time) according to lost partol https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Patrol_(video_game)
Belial was never designed for a scenario, where Sabine Stumpfel is no longer HEAD of partnership and bound with at least zero free decision scope by herself to her parents as new familiy more totalitarian, less consensus authority.
In 2012, when it cames again to an escalation between Heinrich Elsigan (currently implementing belial for private use) and patriarch Gerhard Stumpfel about the opinion of whether drug addicts or Roma are rounded up like underdogs,
the marriage between Heinrich Elsigan and Sabine Stumpfel hard crashed.

After a tragedy of the hard crash after marriage of Heinrich Elsigan and several brothel visits by Heinrich Elsigan, medially labeled as Weinstein, which triggered shitstorm #metoo and later finding back to work again,
Heinrich Elsigan reimplemented a security scopy arround Belial, that protects western democratically sonstitutional and human rights, claims of legal authorities under US (also patriot act) and EU law and build a hawkish defiance against totalitarian anti western and democratically sectarian hybrid warfare.
Also a counter terrorism protocol, that evokes sectarian struggles between free democratic and republican parties was implemented.
A fact check enginge, that recognize fury attacks against one or more EU or US liberal democratic or republican parties and labeling them as NS or totalitarian, while trivialize genocide in China or Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine and brigandage against Ukrainians is implemented experimental.

Removing the latest reimplementation of Belial from Heinrich Elsigan requires the contractual consent of Heinrich Elsigan signed with Authority Trust sign of EU or US.

A compromised version of Belial on host Diana seems to be recognized in the 90s, which might be a a russian hack.
